      This is a page a simple page
      <div>
          and here is more content we don't want
      </div>
      and here is contant that is soo long but doesnt have any children so really there is no way to know how to chunk it in a reliable manner, so we might as well skip it; will not be a problem with typical APIs because those will allow e.g. 10k+ chars
