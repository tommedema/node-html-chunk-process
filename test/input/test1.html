      This is a page a simple page
      <div>
          and here is more content we don't want
      </div>
      Here is content that is very long but doesnt have any children. Really there is no way to know how to chunk it in a reliable, cross-script, and cross-language manner. Skipping this fragment should not be a problem with typical APIs because those will allow over thousands of characters, at which point this would not be a fragment without children.
